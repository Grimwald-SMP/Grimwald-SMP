## Worlds

- Unfortunately we have run into issues in the past with losing/corruption of our world downloads before backing them up so some worlds are missing.

## Credit where credit is due...

- You are free to play on these worlds but do not attempt to claim credit for creating them.
- If you want to post something from these worlds you can but at the very least you should credit Grimwald SMP and mention if you were not the builder.
- Crediting individual builders may be difficult especially in populated areas or if you were not part of the server this season, So there is no need to do this, however you can if you want.
